# Same app written in different technologies

The purpose of this repo is for self-learning only.<br/>
Each version / directory is self-sufficient with its own README, versioning and docker image.<br/>
Each version / directory is a startwars-plot-generator webapp (simple formular for generating a starwars plot).
But each is using different set of technlogies (see below).<br/>
The idea is to learn new technologies by doing the same but in a different way and
learn from it.
